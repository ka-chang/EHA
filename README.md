Between January - June 2022, EHA contracted a team of Evans Analysts to assist in the development of a communities of opportunity criteria. In 2021, EHA received [HUD's Moving to Work (MTW) designation](https://www.hud.gov/mtw), which allows them more flexibility with federal dollars and the opportunity to design and test innovative strategies. Part of EHA's effort under MTW is to explore potential of identifying community of opportunity zones within Everett, particular aligned with their [2020-2024 Five Year Strategic Plan](http://www.evha.org/sites/default/files/page_attachments/wa006v02.pdf) that focuses on "development activities [that] will address the effects of institutional racism by championing diversity, equity and inclusion."

## Data Source

OSPI has a variety of data publicly available through data.wa.gov and ERDC (Education Research and Data Center). [Washington State Report Card](https://washingtonstatereportcard.ospi.k12.wa.us) data is of greater for EHA due to its agency compiled achievement data 

National education data sources from the [National Center for Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/) and [Civil Rights Data Collection](https://ocrdata.ed.gov/?src=go) may also be of interest with collected school-level information not systemically collected by the state.

To match with our use of 2015-2019 ACS data, all data is from the 2018-19 school year.
